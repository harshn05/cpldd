# cpldd
Deployment script for Qt/C++ executable programs, which essentially copies all "dll" dependencies into a single folder along with the executable itself. The script itself is written in python. cpldd utilizes the console output of ldd.exe from msys2 runtime. In general, the script can be utilized to deploy Qt or Non Qt-C/C++ executables irrespective of the compiler toolchain (MSVC/MSYS2/Mingw/Cygwin) which has been used to build the executable. It is assumed that the shell/cmd environment in which the cpld is run, has all the dependencies in its path. If not so, only partial dependencies will be copied.
